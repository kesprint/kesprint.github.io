## About

The KESPRINT Consortium is a multi-national collaboration for the discovery, confirmation and characterization of planet candidates from the K2 space mission. Given the limited amount of telescope time, our natural focus is the detection of the most exciting objects, rather than attempting to provide complete catalogues.

We have three main scientific goals:

1) Measure the masses of rocky planets. This requires discovering planets with ultra-short orbits orbiting bright stars, so that these measurements are achievable with current instruments.

2) Discovery of low-density planets suitable for atmospheric characterization. While low-density Earth-size planets will be out of reach, our goal to search for low-density gaseous planets of any size.

3) To conduct a search for hot and habitable zone rocky planets around all the M-dwarfs in the K2 fields, which are brighter than I=13 mag.

Our team has several pipelines for the detection of planet candidates from K2 raw light curves, and has been awarded competitive open time at international telescopes.
