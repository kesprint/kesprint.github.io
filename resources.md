###Telescope Resources

KESPRINT does not have any guaranteed time for the follow up efforts of planet candidates, and relies on open time applications. Nevertheless, our team has an excellent track record in this respect, and we regularly obtain time for:

- AO, Speckle, and Lucky Imaging: AO188@Subaru Telescope, NESSI@WIYN, and FC@TCS
- Seeing limited photometry: MUSCAT@Okayima, MUSCAT2@TCS, and CAMELOT@IAC80
- Reconnaissance spectroscopy and moderate-precision radial velocity (3-10 m/s): FIES@NOT, and Tull@2.7m-McDonald Observatory
- Highly stable spectrographs (~1 m/s): HARPS@3.6m-ESO, HARPS-N@TNG, HDS@SUBARU, CARMENES@CaHa, and HIRES@Keck
